                <h2>Peer review critical in the election period</h2>
                <p>In Zimbabwean journalism, there is a see no evil, hear no evil approach.This is premised on the camaraderie which is shared in the media industry</p>
                <p>
                  In an industry with little pay, numerous obstacles, and few opportunities, it is commendable that active practitioners share cordiality.
                  To their credit, today's journalists have tried as much as they can to wade off the manifestation of polarisation beyond the content they write or broadcast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, journalism is a practice with flaws, and there is a need for peer review - colleagues sharing honest feedback during the content creation process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The peer review is important, especially in the run-up to an important national event like an election, where the media is the conduit between the electorate and those who seek office.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More media content is consumed during elections than during what I term normal times.
                  The people are at the mercy of the media and content creators wield a lot of power.
                  As we have seen in the past, some are consumed by the temptation to abuse this power, whether wilfully or otherwise.
                  Journalists should become each other's keepers and peer reviewers.
                </p>
                <h4><b>The Political Hand Sometimes Becomes Too Strong</b></h4>
                <p>
                  It is common cause that some platforms, newspapers, and radio stations exist at the mercy of political players, and editorial positions are decided at a political level.
                  Although in Zimbabwe, this has become to be accepted as part of the status quo, this is a very abnormal state of affairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why progressive societies shun political interference in journalistic processes is that it absolves the appointing grouping from scrutiny, which is the core reason why journalism exists in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have noticed that women have no courage they cannot stand the trauma they get when campaigning in terms of violence which comes physically, morally, and spiritually. Women cannot bear that.
                  Also, because there are male counterparts, those who are married have problems with their male counterparts as most men cannot stand women who want to go into politics and into parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under such circumstances, there is the temptation among journalists whose roles are based on the benevolence of politicians to go in overdrive, sometimes resorting to crass propaganda.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of this propaganda may be delivered through outright lies or inflammatory language.
                  The journalism fraternity's role is to call each other to order when such happens.
                </p>
                <h4><b>Politics Is Emotional, and Emotions are Political</b></h4>
                <p>
                  Journalists are voters too. They are affected by the issues at the center of the election debate. Exchange rate, cost of living, poor roads, electricity problems, and other challenges affecting Zimbabweans are extending to journalists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The average journalist is affected by the state of affairs worse than the greater percentage of the population.
                  This view is informed by the paltry earnings which they are taking home.
                  With these issues at play, it is easy for journalists to get emotional in their coverage.
                  While emotions are valid, the golden rule in journalism is never to embed ourselves in the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It may be difficult to exercise restraint when the issues are also affecting the content creators and especially with the absurd manner in which some of the political players think as well as speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These emotions can be reflected in the content, and it is easy for the content to become biased, unhinged, or in some circumstances, degenerate to hate speech.
                  Journalists need to have forums where they can remind each other of the basics of the craft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But when we talk, we say why do women want favours, why do they want assistance, they should compete equally with fellow politicians.
                  "We must come up with measures whether legal or administrative whatever we do, to ensure the situation that is there is a fair situation that is why we come to equity. Equity basically means fairness," she said.
                </p>
                <h4><b>Money can exchange hands</b></h4>
                <p>
                  Journalism has many passionate players, but at the end of the day, bills must be paid.
                  When elections are done, candidates prepare budgets to induce the writing of articles, smearing of opponents, and other media tactics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rich politicians prey on journalists, and it sometimes reflects on the content.
                  There must be open conversations to save platforms and rescue them from becoming newsletters that do stenography for political players.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, it is a moral issue, which is difficult to regulate but there have to be attempts to bring sanity to the profession which sometimes gets lost during the proverbial silly season.
                </p>
                <h4><b>One rotten apple contaminates others</b></h4>
                <p>
                  Sometimes audiences cannot tell apart reporters or platforms. Newspaper journalists will be branded with the same brush, “newspapers lie.” The same applies to online platforms, which are still fighting for space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If one online platform is caught being compromised journalistically, all online publications may have their credibility affected. This is why all well-meaning content creators should find cordial ways to relay feedback to colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Granted, it is not an accessible space, as it will be like advising a competitor, but an attempt has to be made. It can be structured in an impersonal way but allows for regular feedback in the same way academia gives its peer review.
                  There is already the Voluntary Media Council of Zimbabwe, which has the infrastructure in place, although one feels they could be more vibrant. If journalists take this route, they would be one of many professions to do so. Lawyers through the Law Society of Zimbabwe run a similar model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Peer review is not a witch-hunt but a sign of a maturing profession.
                  Journalism comes with much freedom, which includes minimal external interference.
                  There are no better people to engage colleagues on matters of principle than the journalists themselves.
