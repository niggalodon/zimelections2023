                <h2>Five years on, Mnangagwa did "nothing" to address the August 1 shootings</h2>
                <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration has been criticised for tarnishing the credibility of the upcoming 2023 elections by failing to implement reforms in the security sector tabled in the Motlanthe Commission recommendations.</p>
                <p>
                  The military came under international scrutiny following the August 1, 2018 shootings which claimed 6 civilians, and left 35 injured from gunshot wounds.
                  Soon after the embarrassing violations, Mnangagwa came under international pressure to sanitise his administration from global criticism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tuesday 1 August marked exactly five years since Mnangagwa was urged to reform the security sector and compensate victims. With a few weeks left for the country to hold harmonised general elections again, critics are afraid that history may repeat itself especially because there Mnangagwa’s administration failed to institute any reforms since 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an interview with this publication, political commentator, student leader, and a fierce critic of the ZANU-PF regime, Tapiwanashe Chiringa said it is "insulting and sad" that Mnangagwa's government has done "nothing" to address the August 1 shootings and its implications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Government has done little to nothing regarding implementing the recommendations of the Motlanthe Commission which it constituted to investigate the murders of August 1 2018," Chiriga said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In October 2022, we were informed that the government had paid the victims and their families the local currency equivalent of $US2. It's insulting and sad. The Commission made other recommendations like the auditing of army standing orders for riot control and publishing the results. They were never followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The recommendations on ensuring prosecution and accountability for those who killed defenseless citizens have been ignored in totality and this continues to encourage impunity in as far as political and electoral violence is concerned."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chiriga, a former secretary general of one of the most vibrant students organisation in the country, the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) further accused the President of hijacking the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) an organisation that was created by the Constitution to advocate for peace before, during and after elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Mnangagwa also hijacked the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission's attempts at National Dialogue in 2018 and turned them into the caricature that POLAD (Political Actors Dialogue) became.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "In summary, the government has not done much in following the recommendations of the Motlanthe Commission. The little that has been is a mockery to the Commission and an insult to the victims," he added.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She said people should be allowed to freely campaign, adding that anyone who is loved by the people will be voted for into office without beating anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another commentator who preferred to be anonymous said the government failed to institute an Independent Complaints Commission, a platform report for people who would have been harassed by the security members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think the government has not done enough in terms of addressing the issues around the August 1, 2018 shootings. Because remember that post the shootings there was a commission that was appointed by the President which is known as the Motlanthe Commission. The Commission actually recommended that there be compensation for these victims. It also advised that there be electoral reforms that will ensure that such conflict is resolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But all those issues have not been addressed. We're going into an election without the new electoral act for instance. But, fundamentally important is the issue of section 10 in the Independent Complaints Commission which was supposed to be set up to ensure that members of the public can raise their complaints against wayward security sector members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those people that abuse members of the public are supposed to be reported against through the Independent Complaints Commission which is yet to be set up," the analyst said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "So, I would think that, five years on, nothing has been done and there is no accountability on the part of those that actually killed members of the public. Nothing has been done also on the part of those that are supposed to be compensated. I think we have a long way to go and there is a need for the government to address these issues."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite all these issues having been not addressed, the country will hold another plebiscite on the 23rd of August this year. International observers like the European Union have since dispatched representatives across the nation to analyse the electoral environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Families of those who were killed and those who suffered physical injuries have not been compensated despite being identified and named in the Monthlante Commission’s report.
                  Dzikamai Chivango, an August 1 victim, bemoaned how his chronic left leg damage, sustained from the shootings, prevented him from working as a commuter bus driver to support his family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have received no compensation; I was shot in the leg, which now has permanent numbness. I used to be a commuter omnibus driver before the August 1 shootings, but I can't anymore since my leg is numb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It pains me that five years after the incident, I still haven't been compensated, and to make matters worse, I can't support my two children, ages 10 and six, and my uncle has stepped in to pay their school fees."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I implore the government and human rights officials to ensure that we receive compensation for this traumatic experience," said Chivango.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Precious Mabenga, an informal trader who trades on First Street and Nelson Mandela Avenue in Harare who was attacked and incurred lifelong damage to his chest on August 1, criticised how the incident was used for political expediency while the victims were to date not compensated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "We get a lot of interviews from the media and attention from civic organisations as August 1 approaches, but to date, nothing has changed and we haven't been compensated.
                  "I recall attending a workshop given by a local human rights pressure group where we were just paraded to discuss our traumatic story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Had pictures shot, then merely given lunch, and it stopped there with no compensation. It's terrible to open up about your traumatic experience on multiple occasions and still receive no compensation," said Mabenga.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I was beaten, not sure I think there were four soldiers and was left in critical condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Some folks including colleagues who work in offices near where I work and notice me because of the August 1 incidents tend to joke about August 1 approaching and soldiers finishing this time around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "They are unaware of the emotional agony and suffering they cause me, despite the fact that they believe their jokes are harmless," decried Mabenga.
