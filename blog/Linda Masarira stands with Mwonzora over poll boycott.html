                <h2>Linda Masarira stands with Mwonzora over poll boycott</h2>
                <p>Labour Economists and Afrikan Democrats (LEAD) says it is in support of a decision by MDC-T leader Douglas Mwonzora to withdraw from the 2023 Presidential race</p>
                <p>
                  Mwonzora has previously promised that he was going to win the 2023 Presidential race by over 60% has seen his political allies going to get nominated, whe others have joined Zanu-PF.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The legal practitioner-cum politicians is believed to have withdrawn from the race in solidarity with his 87 parliamentary candidates that were not nominated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is also not happy with the general conduct of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission in terms of election preparation and management.
                  How, in a statement Linda Masarira said she is supporting Mwonzoraâ€™s move all the way.

                  Sometime ago, I registered my concerns about the flawed delimitation report and suggested that the process be redone. Ironically, myself included had settled to just go into the elections without the contentious issues being addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond the delimitation report was also the issue of the unconstitutional amendment of the constitution on the provincial Council seats, which Labour Economists and Afrikan Democrats (LEAD) challenged SI 114 of 2023 demanding a declaration of constitutional invalidity of the statutory instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The electoral amendment bill was passed into law way after the proclamation date, which means it is invalid for use for 2023 harmonized elections. Apparently @ZECzim chose to unilaterally and illegally pick some provisions from the amendment of the electoral act.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sadly, because of desperation for elections, most political parties decided to ignore all these glaring irregularities. Basing on these facts, 2023 elections are already a sham and not worth the salt. Vamwe vachazoda kuchema mavara azara ivhu after elections but it will be too late.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is no electoral spirit within the masses, no electoral excitement at all. My conclusion is voter apathy is real this coming election she said.
                  Zimbabwe is heading for polls on the 23rd of August this in an elections that has been marred by court challenges.
                  Leading contenders Emmerson Mnangagwa and Nelson Chamisa are both bullish ahead of the polls.
