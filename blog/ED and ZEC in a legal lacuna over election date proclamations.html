                  Babra Ontibile Bhebe, Executive Director, Election Resource Centre has revealed that the proclamation of elections has no barring on the implementation of the amendments of the electoral bill which is currently in parliament.

                  "The proclamation of an election has no baring on the implementation of any amendments to
                  the electoral act. If the amendments to the Act are signed even after proclamation they will

                  The Bill needs to be finalised as it will operationalise the latest constitutional amendments for
                  the election of 10 youth members of the National Assembly, one from each province, as well as the
                  continued election of 60 women, six from each province, to the National Assembly under a party-list system
                </p>
                <p>
                  "However, in terms of the youth quota, the amendments potentially give guidelines on the nomination
                  process for the youth quota therefore it is imperative for the amendments to be approved before proclamation,
                  because it will leave ZEC in a legal lacuna as to how to effect the nomination process for the youth quota," added ERC executive director Bhebe

                  The harmonised elections will be held between July 26 and August 26 this year
                  "In terms of international best practice, amendments to the electoral laws must be effected 6 months before an election to ensure buy in and time
                  for stakeholders to adjust to the amendments," she added whilst currently Zimbabwe is left with less between 3 to 4 months before the harmonised election.

                  that there is need to expeditiously deal with the Bill.
                  “Indeed we need to have it passed before proclamation of elections. Once we manage to do that, it will be used for the forthcoming elections. We will definitely
                  prioritise the Bill and I do not see any impediment from having it passed on time. We will definitely be on time,” said Minister Ziyambi.

                  ZEC is empowered to carry out this exercise in terms of Sections 160 and 161 of the Zimbabwe Constitution and Section 37a of the Electoral Act.
                  If a general election is held less than six months after a delimitation, the old constituency and ward boundaries must be used for the election, according to Section 161(2)] of the Constitution.
