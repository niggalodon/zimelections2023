                <h2>Zim holds shambolic election, marred by violence, late delivery of ballot papers, CSOs arrests</h2>
                <p>Zimbabwe's Wednesday election was marred by embarrassing electoral anomalies and delays in the delivery of ballot papers in opposition strongholds amid a bare-faced crackdown on two independent election watchdog organizations.</p>
                <p>
                  Wednesday's chaotic election which extended to Thursday a controversial proclamation disfranchised thousands of urban people who were frustrated from casting their votes after queuing for more than 12-18 hours while others tenaciously camped until the ballot papers came to cast their votes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bulawayo, Harare and Mutare were the biggest casualty of this unprecedented poll delay which has already tarnished the credibility and integrity of this election which is likely to be contested
                </p>
                <p>
                  ZESN and ERC officials were conducting parallel tabulation recommended by ZEC chairperson Justice Priscilla Chigumba.
                  National police spokesperson Paul Nyathi in a Wednesday statement justified the arrests accusing ZESN and ERC for conducting 'illegal' votes parallel tabulation.

                <p>
                  "A total of 93 smart cellphones, 38 laptops, two (2) smart watches, two (2) modems, one (1) WIFI router, one (1) external hard drive, Nokia feature phone (kambudzi), one (1) printer, 1 X 24 port switch, various computer chargers, power back-up unit and headphones were recovered."
                  "The equipment was being used to unlawfully tabulate election voting statistics and results from polling stations throughout the country. These figures were being supplied by some observers and political party agents," said Nyathi.

                  Various civic organizations have however slammed the police raids as well choreographed script to undermine the integrity and credibility of the elections.
                  Vocal outspoken Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), on Friday condemned the arrest of ERC and ZESN officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "We have studied the press statement from Zimbabwe Republic Police which in short alleges that owning ICT gadgets is now criminalised."
                  "We condemn the arbitrary arrest of 40 ZESN and ERC on strange allegations of being suspected to be planning to announce results."
                  "Free them now," read the ARTUZ statement.
