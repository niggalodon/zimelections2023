                <h2>Zimbabwean elections marred by perpetual political violence</h2>
                <p>Despite several efforts by the International community, civil society organisations and election observers for Zimbabwe to end the culture of political violence, especially during polls, the southern African country continues to experience massive political violations with the latest being the murder of an opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) activist in Riverside area, Glen Norah near Tanaka Grounds, Harare. </p>
                <p>
                  Dozens of CCC activists were violently blocked from holding a rally in the high-density suburb before a CCC supporter identifi ed as Tinashe Chitsunge was stoned to death by alleged ZANU-PF thugs
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Zimbabwe Republic Police confirms an incident of public violence in the Riverside area, Glen Norah near Tanaka Grounds, Harare on 3rd August 2023 at 1300 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "One person is confirmed dead as a result of the clashes. The scene is being attended by all relevant Police sections. A detailed statement will be issued in due course," Nyathi said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More media content is consumed during elections than during what I term normal times.
                  The people are at the mercy of the media and content creators wield a lot of power.
                  As we have seen in the past, some are consumed by the temptation to abuse this power, whether wilfully or otherwise.
                  Journalists should become each other's keepers and peer reviewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  CCC spokesperson Fadzayi Mahere said alleged ZANU-PF thugs killed the opposition activist.
                  "He was stoned to death by suspected ZANU PF thugs. The thugs ambushed a group of our youths when they were heading to a rally in Glen View 7," Mahere said.

                  Heal Zimbabwe, a peace-based organisation has since argued that the frequency of political violence has already undermined the credibility of the upcoming plebiscite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have noticed that women have no courage they cannot stand the trauma they get when campaigning in terms of violence which comes physically, morally, and spiritually. Women cannot bear that.
                  Also, because there are male counterparts, those who are married have problems with their male counterparts as most men cannot stand women who want to go into politics and into parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The rise in cases of political violence over the past few months is because of the shortcomings by institutions particularly the police, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC), and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) to deal decisively with human rights abuses, violence, hate speech and intolerance as they are mandated to do by the Constitution of Zimbabwe. The inaction of these institutions in the face of violence and human rights abuses is a serious abdication from duty that has emboldened and aided perpetrators as they act with impunity while putting hundreds of citizens in harm's way.
                </p>

                  Some of this propaganda may be delivered through outright lies or inflammatory language.
                  The journalism fraternity's role is to call each other to order when such happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Political violence, intimidation, and all forms of human rights abuses with impunity have already undermined the credibility of the 2023 election and put the country at the risk and precipice of conflict and chaos," the organisation said following the gruesome murder of Chitsunge.

                  The average journalist is affected by the state of affairs worse than the greater percentage of the population.
                  This view is informed by the paltry earnings which they are taking home.
                  With these issues at play, it is easy for journalists to get emotional in their coverage.
                  While emotions are valid, the golden rule in journalism is never to embed ourselves in the story.
                </p>

                  Zimbabwean elections continue to be marred by political violence with the violations largely characterising main political parties.
                  In March last year, Mboneni Ncube, a CCC activist, was killed by a spear by suspected ZANU-PF members in Kwekwe during the party's by-elections rally. Dozens were injured during the violent melee.
                  Zimbabwe will hold elections on the 23rd of August this year. But the dexterous violence exhibited by soldiers, killing at least six people during 2018 post-election demonstrations has not been resolved.
