                <h2>Gukurahundi victims denied voting rights</h2>
                <p>Victims of the Gukurahundi massacres which saw the death of over 20 000 civilians in the Matebeleland and Midlands regions over three decades ago are still being denied the right to vote.
                  During the genocide many documents were lost or destroyed among them National Identity documents while people lost their lives.
                  Among the deceased are parents and grandparents who would have been responsible to register their keen.
                  This has left thousands of people undocumented thus being denied access to services and many rights including the right to vote.
                  Prominent journalist Mlondolozi Ndlovu who worked with Amnesty International Zimbabwe in producing the ‘Statelessness’ report said many Gukurahundi victims struggle to get identity documents.</p>
                <p>“There is a challenge of people in areas affected by Gukurahundi,” he said.
                  “Some of them lost their parents and grandparents so they cannot access these documents.</p>
                <blockquote class="vizew-blockquote mb-15">
                  <h5 class="blockquote-text">“What it means is that this becomes a legacy because if your father did not have an ID, you do not have an ID, your kids will not have an ID and as such it then affects the right to education, the right to health care, and such other rights.”
                    Ndlovu said denying one an identity card equates to denying them rights to choose.”</h5>
                  <h6>Lead president Linda Musarira</h6>
                </blockquote>
                <p>“We demand combined rallies where people in Harare South constituency will gather at a same venue and get addressed by MPs candidates on the same day,” she said.
                  “No one will be required to wear party regalia. MPs or Presidents or Council candidates will then address the same audience one after another.
                  “That is the most efficient and proper way to come up with free fair credible elections.”
                  Alternatively, Musarira called for an equal share of available resources.
                  “If that can’t happen, then, let’s have all contestants be given their own share in groups,” she said.
                  “We give each and every MP candidate a car, fuel coupons and food allowance then together with his team of councillors, they use those resources to campaign on their own as a group.”</p>
